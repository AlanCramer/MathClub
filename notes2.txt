What's a function?

    Domain 
    Range 
    notation - 
       f: R1 -> R1 (e.g. sin or x*x)
       f: R2 -> R1   (e.g. magnitude)
       f: R2xR2 -> R2  (e.g. add)
    
    Does a function have to have a graph?


What's a Vector? 
    Column of Numbers 
    A magnitude (length) and direction 
    A thing that we know how to add and scale 

Vector operations: 

    Add            f: RNxRN -> RN 
    Scale          f: RNxR1 -> RN 
    Dot Product    f: ?
    Cross Product  f: ?

What's the domain and range of dot and cross products?
What's the length of <1, 1>?
What's the length of <1,1,1> ?
What's the angle between <0, 4> and <2,0>?
What's the angle between <1, 1> and <1,0>?

Quadradic formula - why?

Throw a ball - at every moment, the ball has:
  a position (a point - or we can think of it as a vector)
  a velocity (how fast and what direction) (a vector)
  and an acceleration (gravity, wind, etc.) (a vector)

velocity is "how fast the ball position is changing" 
acceleration is "how fast the velocity is changing" 

constant acceleration 
a(t) = (-9.8m/s)/s    : not changing as time changes 
v(t) = v0 + a*t       : changing linearly with time 
p(t) = p0 + v0*t + (1/2) a*t*t  

These are vector equations!  
They work (look the same) in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. 
  1: throw a ball straight up
  2: throw a ball to the outfield
  3: throw a ball in a side wind 

for 2D: 
    p(t) = <x(t), y(t)>
    v(t) = <v0 cos(theta) * t, v0 sin(theta) * t >
    a(t) = <0, -9.8>
