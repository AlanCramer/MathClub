1. what's a function (mathematially)
  - transformation R1->R1
  - domain, range
  - graph 
  - Rn->Rm 

2. What's a vector
  - physics (engineering)
  - comp sci 
  - math 
    - addition, scale
    - associativity, communitivity, distributivity 
    - functions, polynomials, signals, lots of other stuff
  - Rn 

3. What's a linear transformation?
  - T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)
  - T(ax) = aT(x) 
any guess why that's called linear?


4. What's the (parametric) equation of a line 
  - 2D 
  - 3D 
  - nD 

5. what's a dot product?
