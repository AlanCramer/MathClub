1. what's a function (mathematially)
  - transformation R1->R1
  - domain, range
  - graph 
  - Rn->Rm 

2. What's a vector
  - physics (engineering)
  - comp sci 
  - math 
    - addition, scale
    - associativity, communitivity, distributivity 
    - functions, polynomials, signals, lots of other stuff
  - Rn 

3. what operations can we do on a vector?
  
4. What's a linear transformation?
  - T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)
  - T(ax) = aT(x) 
any guess why that's called linear?

For the Club: 
We are going to build our own graphics engine (on Helix) with an emphasis on animations.


Assignment:

    Write a project that:
        draws a shape (triangle) in the first quadrant
        create a function R2->R2 that 
            reflects that shape across the x-axis 
            translates that shape below the x-axis 
        animate that transformation 
        create a function that flips the shape across the line y=x 
    Share and _explain_ your demo 

    Start thinking about what our geometry engine should look like. 
    I'm picturing 3 modules:
        - Math Util 
            Vector2, Matrix4 
        - Data Model 
            AddTriangle()
            AddTranformationFunction() 
        - Visualization 
            DrawTriangle 
            AnimateTriangle(triangle, transformation)



5. What's the (parametric) equation of a line 
  - 2D 
  - 3D 
  - nD
